# DH150 – Usability Testing – Assignment 2

### Introduction

#### General reason for my usability testing
In general, the purpose of usability testing is to capture the real users voice and behavior 
while they actually use the product. By collecting data of their actual interactions with the product, we can improve the
usability of the product by troubleshooting potential design issues as we see firsthand the user-friendliness of the website.
With usability testing, user experience researchers are able to uncover more global usability issues that common users make 
and maximize satisfaction.

#### What I am testing
The usability test I decided to do was on Psychology Today, a magazine dedicated to making psychology accessible to the general public. The magazine's website aims 
to showcase therapy and health care professional directories and psychologist-written articles about the self.
I wanted to investigate how much more efficient the website could be for the user, especially when it comes to finding 
mental health. Already in my heuristic evaluation (which can be found [here](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class)) there were a list of usability issues that needed to be fixed, but in my
experiment, I found even more problems, such as the search function being very difficult to navigate and the failure to compartmentalize
information more cohesively. 

#### What the test was like
In my UT, I held it in my dorm room in a very relaxed environment to sort of make it as peaceful as a psychologist room. 
I used a live version of Psychology Today's website located on my laptop, having an external camera record my test subjects
while I was sitting next to them in the event that they had any questions. The session was able to catch their navigational choices, 
task completion rates, comments, overall satisfaction ratings, questions and feedback. 

#### How the test was executed
Each individual session lasted approximately 15 minutes. During the session, I explained the test session and asked the participant 
to fill out a brief background questionnaire, in which they read the task scenarios and tried to find the information on the website. 
In addition, I included a pre-test to gauge my participant's thoughts beforehand on how accessible the website appeared for first impressions.

I introduced my participants to a series of tasks, in which I asked the partiI woucipant to rate the interface on a 5-point Likert Scale with measures ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree: 
* Search "depression" for an overview
* Search your "zip code or city" for a therapist
* Search for a "self test" for depression

After the last task was completed, I asked my participants on a Product Satisfaction Card page to see what their opinions
on Psychology Today were after interacting with the website. The individual would choose five adjectives from the following list
that they think best describe their personal reactions to the website: boring, busy, calm, cheap, creative, cutting-edge,
exciting, expensive, familiar, fresh, impressive, innovative, inspiring, intimidating, old, professional, trustworthy, unprofessional.

Finally, I asked a few questions about their background that were kept completely confidential in order to view demographics.

#### Test materials
You can find a Google Form link of my experiment right [here.](https://forms.gle/A6sLbhJhG6jTa3Ug8)

#### Test video

Unfortunately, I was unable to utilize Silverback to record my subject simultaneously,
but you can stream both alongside each other. You can find the screen recording [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tp80r1o9yv19mt9/Steph%20Chang.mov?dl=0) 
and you can find the video with the test subject [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wtlvhd8nugjyolq/IMG_8859.MOV?dl=0).

#### Some closing remarks
My first UT experiment had its flaws, but for the most part, it was really fascinating being able to see how the user would
interact with the website. I learned during the pilot test that the cluttered mess as analyzed in my heuristic evaluation were
one of the reasons it was so convoluted to use. Overall, the experiment went well, as the test subject was able to follow all of the instructions
with ease. However, I should have been more precise with my questions, as there was an error that came up nearing the pretest
section. I really would like to improve my UT by delving into a different facet of usability instead of search. There are a lot
of issues associated with Psychology Today, but the search really piqued my interest as I wanted to see how clutter would play
a role in finding necessary information.
